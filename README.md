# Airplane-price-prediction
Predicting airplane prices using Python

1. Cleaned and Processed Dataset manually.
2. Did some exploratory data analysis to check important values, as well as understand the correlation between some of our features and our target (airplane price). - **airplane_price_eda**
3. Assembled and compared a few basic regression models. - **airplane_price_prediction.py**
4. Built an ensemble model to try to refine our predicted values accuracy. - **In Progress**
5. Built a Deep Learning Model to see if a Neural Network would be better at predicting prices than our other models. - **In Progress**

Files titled with "testing" were used to test different methods, practices, and code as I tried to solve our regression problem.
