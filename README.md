# Airplane-price-prediction
Predicting airplane prices using Python

1. Cleaned and Processed Dataset manually.
2. Did some exploratory data analysis to check important values, as well as understand the correlation between some of our features and our target (airplane price). - **airplane_price_eda.py**
3. Assembled a few basic regression models, predicted prices, and then compared our prediction accuracy for each model. - **airplane_price_prediction.py**
4. Built an ensemble model to try to refine our predicted values accuracy. - **In Progress**
5. Built a Deep Learning Model to see if a Neural Network would be better at predicting prices than our other models. - **In Progress**

Files titled with "testing" were used to test different methods, practices, and code as I tried to solve the regression problem at hand. They are essentially **very** rough drafts, feel free to take a look if you'd like an idea of some of the different methods that were tried and may have failed.
